PIC LCD Library

Welcome to the LCD Library for PIC. It is a derivate of the original LiquidCrystal Library as sourced in the Arduino SDK. 
It has been ported to PIC by Ivan de Jesus Deras (ideras@gmail.com).  As the original library this one is extendable if need be.

It supports most Hitachi HD44780 based LCDs, or compatible, connected to any project using 4bit mode only.

This port doesn't support neither Shift Regiter nor I2C IO expander, but it can be easily extended to support them.

You can find the original library at

Tested only on PIC16F887 !
